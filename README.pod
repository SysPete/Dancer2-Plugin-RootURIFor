=head1 NAME

Dancer2::Plugin::RootURIFor - Mountpoint-agnostic uri builder for Dancer2

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your PSGI runner, you have multiple apps:

    builder {
        mount '/app1' => App1->to_app;
        mount '/app1' => App1->to_app;
    }

In your app, you would like to redirect or link between them:

    package App1;

    use Dancer2;
    use Dancer2::Plugin::RootURIFor;

    get '/redir' => sub {
        redirect root_uri_for('/app2');
    };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Dancer2::Plugin::RootURIFor provides a way to link to resources on your service
which reside outside your application's mount point. This is useful as we can
retain URI scheme, server name, port etc. without resorting to querying request
parameters.

It should act exactly like uri_for, except it simply ignores the application's
base uri.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 root_uri_for

Returns a URI with the server's root URI as its base.

    root_uri_for '/hello';
    # Returns something like 'https://yourservice/hello'

You can also pass a hashref to generate URI parameters:

    root_uri_for '/hello', { looking_for => 'me' };
    # Returns something like 'https://yourservice/hello?looking_for=me
